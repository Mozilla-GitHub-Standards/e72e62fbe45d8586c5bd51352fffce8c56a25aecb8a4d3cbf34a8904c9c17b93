# Mozilla IoT hackaton

This project is the result of the Mozilla IoT hackaton.
Basically, the webpage tells you the temperature taken from sensors when you say "Mozilla give me the temperature!".

This project uses the [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/webspeechapi.html)

## Setup

Launch `index.html` from web server and reach it with [a browser that support those APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).
